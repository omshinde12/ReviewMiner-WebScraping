I'm using Denver Hamilton Series from 2011. But the Imperial one i never tried before. The green one is musky and smells like fresh cut grass (which could be the clone of Creed Green Irish tweed that costs around 30k) The white one is beautiful floral and powdery/creamy also has sandalwood in base which gives it a good projection. Both are long lasting but Imperial one is suitable for Hot summer while green one is suitable for fall/Rainy days and winters but in summer it is also wearable.Als...READ MORE,5,"Certified Buyer, Mangaldoi"

Wow... Best Deo especially the green one. I use Deo on dress and not on body as it may create some skin problems. All other deos stay for about 30 mins to one hour on dress whereas Denver gives good fragnance for almost 10 to 12 hours. Love this product.READ MORE,5,"Certified Buyer, Chennai"
